Simple app to demonstrate address insertion and search

Frontend notes:

run the command: npm install
    to run the application you need to install the packages

the following command inside a script: set PORT=3000 && react-scripts start
    is meant for running on windows, on Linux it will be different
    you can choose another port, but make sure to update the CORS settings on the backend

Backend notes:

run the command: dotnet restore 
    is required before running the application 

run the command: dotnet run 
    to build and run the application 

you need the appsettings.* json files to be present in the same directory the backend is running on, when you obtain them place them there 
    these files include the google cloud platform api key for this project
